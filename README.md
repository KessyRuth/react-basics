____VIDEO 1 REACTJS INTRODUCTION
React is an open source Javascript library used for building User Interfaces and Interactive web applications.

It makes it simple to create Single Page Apps(SPAs).

SPAs are web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app. Unlike traditional multi-page websites, where each interaction typically involves loading a new page from the server, SPAs use Javascript to dynamically update the content without needing to reload the entire page.

With SPAs webpages are loaded very quickly and results in a speedy user experience.

Platform used 
IDE - VsCode with Simple React Snippets package installed
*Edit Emmet settings for use in react templates.

_____VIDEO 2 Creating a react app
Create-react-app tool is a command line used to create a starter react project. It is easy to use as it comes with the setups and configurations, (instead of configuring them manually),we need for the project e.g bubble and webpack which we use to compile our code to production code
It is a command in node.js, which is an open-source, cross-platform Javascript runtime environment.

__node.js installation
use npx create-react-app (and the name of the project) to create a starter project.
node.  




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
